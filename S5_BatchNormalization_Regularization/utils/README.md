# This is a modular code for earlier assignment. 
- Will be changing in few module later to adjust for the next assignment like adding condition to integrate different normalization technique

Change your code in such a way that all of these are in their respective files:
- model
- training code
- testing code
- regularization techniques (dropout, L1, L2, etc) # dropout included as parameter in model architecture class
- dataloader/transformations/image-augmentations
- misc items like finding misclassified images # For now its basic plot of inference
